Hi my name is Ryan, and I like cheese
Slayin' all these sweats with my Ratatouille
Got a couple of hobbies, besides my click-speed
Like sniping them nombres while collecting all them seeds
I drink lots of sparkling water, and hang out on my bed
I used to like Liz, but we broke up instead
(it was really because she wouldn't give me head)
Now I just sit back and watch Colin run the show
Waiting for my keyboard whilst on Visual Studio Code
I love NameMC and hangin' with Charles, my bae
Now to end it off, Bedwars, I will play
